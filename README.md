#  A GSM-Based Protocol for Expanding Blockchain Accessibility
---

SMS2Chain is a protocol designed to `bridge GSM technologies` with `blockchain systems`. It leverages the ubiquitous nature of `SIM cards` and `SMS messaging` to enable seamless `transactions`, `wallet management`, and `smart contract interactions` `without requiring an internet connection`. At its core, SMS2Chain allows users to perform blockchain-based operations via familiar mobile interfaces such as STK menus, making blockchain more accessible to underserved demographics and areas with limited internet access.

The building block fo stk2chain is the eSIM Profile that can either be burned int a UICC (SIM Card) or used on an eUICC compitible device via Remote Provisioning (Airdrop)

The eSIM Profile IMSI is a CREATE2 Wallet Smart Contract address generated by ERC-4337 Compliant Smart Contract
and Remote SIM Provisioning is done via an AirDrop
